# ðŸ¤– Motion Planning Projects â€“ IISc

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the **Motion Planning** course during my M.Tech. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)**. Each folder corresponds to a different assignment or mini-project exploring foundational and advanced concepts in robot motion planning.

> ðŸ”¬ This work was completed as part of course project for "Motion Planning" course at IISc, under the guidance of **Prof. Debashish Ghosh**.
